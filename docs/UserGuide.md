## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `sadd n/NAME a/ADDRESS`, `NAME` and `ADDRESS` are parameters which can be used as `sadd n/John Doe Eatery a/ABC Ave`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAGS]` can be used as `n/John Doe Eatery t/opensDaily` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAGS]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/opendaily`, `t/petfriendly` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME a/ADDRESS`, `a/ADDRESS n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/John Doe Eatery n/Jane Doe Eatery`, only `n/Jane Doe Eatery` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `slist`, `rlist`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
