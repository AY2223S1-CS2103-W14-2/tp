### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `sdel 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StallListPanel`, `ReviewListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Stall` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `RAddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a review).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `RAddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `RAddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `RAddCommandParser`, `RDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Stall` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStallList` object) and all `Review` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueReviewList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Stall` and `Review` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Stall>` and `ObservableList<Review>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Stall` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Stall` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `foodwhere.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### **Review Components**
* Added Classes into the model Component to encapsulate a Review

#### **Implementation**
<img src="images/ModelReviewClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

A `Review`,
- is stored in `uniqueReviewList` of the Model

A `Review` contains the following attributes,
1. a `Name`, which represent the name of the Stall associated with the Review
2. a `Date`, which represent the day, month and year as specified in `DD/MM/YYYY` format
3. a `Content`, which represent the review of the Stall by the user
4. a `Rating`, which represent the rating of the Stall from 0 to 5 inclusive
5. can be assigned to a single `Stall`
6. can be assigned multiple `Tags`

#### Design considerations:

#### Aspect: How the components within Review are added or changed
- **Current Choice**: Attributes within `Review` are immutable, meaning that if there is an attribute that has to be edited, a new `Review` object has to be created.
    * Pros: Concept of Immutability is met, making the code less prone to bugs as all components of a `Review` object are fixed
    * Cons: Less flexible, more steps needed in editing `Review` objects
- Alternative 1: Allow certain components within `Review`, like `Date` and `Content`to be mutable
    * Pros: Less overhead as fewer objects are created
    * Cons: Prone to error as a Component might not be correctly changed

### Review Adding feature

#### What is Review Adding feature about?

The Add Review mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. This feature enhances `AddressBook` by allowing to store not only `Stall`, but also `Review`. This is stored internally as a `UniqueStallList` and `UniqueReviewList`. `Review` requires a `Stall` as `Review` is stored in `Stall`. Additionally, the feature implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#addReview(Review)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Adds the `Review` to `UniqueReviewList`

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `radd s/STALL_INDEX d/DATE c/CONTENT r/RATING [t/TAGS]â€¦`

#### Implementation Flow of Review Adding feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Review adding mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: FoodWhere comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. FoodWhere will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user executes `radd s/1 d/20-09-2022 c/The food was good, the chicken rice was fresh. r/4` command to create a new `Review` for `Stall` with index 1.

![AddReview](images/AddReview.png)

#### UML Diagram for Adding Review

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `radd` command:

<img src="images/AddReviewActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:
- The Review adding commands are straight to the point and efficient for users to add Review for Stall in FoodWhere.
- The prefixes allow users to understand what the different types of data fields Review need in order to be created.

### Listing all Reviews feature

#### What is listing all Reviews feature about?

The listing of all reviews mechanism is facilitated by `Model`. This feature allows the user to list all reviews.

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `rlist`

#### Implementation Flow of listing all Reviews feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the listing of all reviews mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: FoodWhere comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. FoodWhere will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user executes `rlist` to list all reviews on the FoodWhere User Interface.

![ListReview](images/ListReview.png)

#### UML Diagram for listing of all Reviews

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `rlist` command:

<img src="images/ListReviewActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

### Review Deleting feature

#### What is Review Deleting feature about?

The Delete Review mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. This feature allows the user to delete a review.

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `rdel REVIEW_INDEX`

#### Implementation Flow of Review Deleting feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the listing of all reviews mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: FoodWhere comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. FoodWhere will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user list all the reviews by entering the `rlist` command.

Step 3. The user executes `rdel 2` command to delete the last review with index 2.

![DeleteReview](images/DeleteReview.png)

#### UML Diagram for Deleting Review

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `rdel` command:

<img src="images/DeleteReviewActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

### Review Editing feature

#### What is Review Editing feature about?

The Edit Review mechanism is facilitated by `REditCommandParser` and `REditCommand`. This feature allows the user to edit a review after it has been created.

`REditCommandParser.parse()` - parses the user input and returns a `REditCommand` object. `REditCommand.execute()` - creates a new `Review` object based on the parsed user input and calls `Model.setReview()` to replace the old `Review` object with the new `Review` object.

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `redit INDEX [d/DATE] [c/CONTENT] [r/RATING] [t/TAGS]â€¦`

#### Implementation Flow of Review Editing feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the listing of all reviews mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: FoodWhere comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. FoodWhere will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user executes `redit 2 r/5` command to edit `Review` with index 2 to edit its rating to 5.

Step 3. Since the user input is valid, the `AddressBookParser` will create a `REditCommandParser` to parse the command arguments, `2 r/5`.

Step 4. `REditCommandParser` will parse the index to a `Index` object and parse other arguments as a `EditReviewDescriptor` object. The `Index` and `EditReviewDescriptor` objects will then be passed to the returned `REditCommand` object as its arguments.

Step 5. In `LogicManager`, the returned `REditCommand` is executed.

Step 6. In the execution of the `REditCommand`, a new `Review` object is created. This `Review` consists of the field(s) from the parsed user input, replacing some field(s) of the original `Review` object. In this case, the original `Review` with index 2 is copied over to a new `Review` object except its `Rating` field which is set as `5`.

Step 7. `model.setReview()` will interact with the model to have it replace the immutable `Stall` which contained the original `Review` with a `Stall` containing the updated `Review`.

![EditReview](images/EditReview.png)

![REditSequenceDiagram](images/REditSequenceDiagram.png)

#### UML Diagram for Editing Review

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `redit` command:

<img src="images/EditReviewActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:
- Multiple fields of a Review can be edited in one go to increase the efficiency of the user of our application.

### Review Sorting feature

#### What is Review Sorting feature about?

The Sort Review mechanism is facilitated by `Model` and `ReviewsComparatorList`. This feature allows the user to sort all reviews by specified criterion.

The list of supported sorting criteria is stored in `ReviewsComparatorList` enum class as enum constants. Each enum constant has a `Comparator<Review>` field that will be passed in as an argument for `Model.sortReviews()` for sorting the review list.

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `rsort CRITERION`

#### Implementation Flow of Review Sorting feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sorting of all reviews mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: FoodWhere comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. FoodWhere will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user executes `rsort reversedname` command to sort `Review` by name (from Z to A, followed by 9 to 0).

Step 3. Since the user input is valid, the `AddressBookParser` will create a `RSortCommandParser` to parse the command arguments, `reversedname`.

Step 4. `RSortCommandParser` will parse the criterion to a `ReviewsComparatorList` object. The `ReviewsComparatorList` object will then be passed to the returned `RSortCommand` object as its argument.

Step 5. In `LogicManager`, the returned `RSortCommand` is executed.

Step 6. `model.sortReviews()` will interact with the model to sort reviews using the custom comparator that is retrieved from `ReviewsComparatorList.getComparator()`.

![SortReview](images/SortReview.png)

#### UML Diagram for Sorting Review

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `rsort` command:

<img src="images/SortReviewActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th stall in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new stall. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the stall was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the stall being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

* **Alternative 3 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book, but ensuring that Stall and Review are both immutable.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, performance issues for memory are not too bad.
  * Cons: This needs Stall and Review to be guaranteed immutable, alongside all their parts. Good test cases are a must.
